        I don't want you to know how much snow settled on my peaks before it even reached October
      </p>

      <p>I don't want you to know</p>

      <p>Before the air grew bitter, and I bitter with it</p>

      <p>I don't want you to know</p>

      <p>Now all that's left are the bitters.</p>

      <p>Tea leaves at the bottom of the cup.</p>

      <p>Stale, stagnant.</p>

      <p>And now I spend this eternity of breath waiting</p>

      <p>for the exhale of warmth,</p>

      <p>the steam that rises,</p>

      <p>holding steadfast to the sky above where I melt.</p>
