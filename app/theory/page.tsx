        About <em>In Amber</em>
      </p>

      <p style={{fontFamily: "sans-serif", fontSize: "1.5rem", marginBottom: "2rem" }}>
        As much as you may have enjoyed the world of In Amber, 
        it has enjoyed you. To be confronted with the empathy 
        of bugs and to discover what that means in a world where 
        the value of life is often misplaced, in humans and other 
        beings alike, can be sobering. My name is Paloma Calvin and I developed
        this project for the 2024-2025 Thompson Prize facilitated by 
        ArtsEngine at the University of Michigan for the Art/Sci residency.
        However, my observation of the hidden world of 
        insects began long before the project itself.</p>


        <p style={{fontFamily: "sans-serif", fontSize: "1.5rem", marginBottom: "2rem" }}>
        In 2020, my fascination started. The original version of 
        the track ‘Attack of Giant Mutant Cicada’ was born as 
        an experiment during COVID-19 lockdowns. In 2023, my 
        interest in bugs was renewed when I started working in Zoology, 
        where my job, in part, was to take care of Dermestid beetle colonies. 
        </p>

        <p style={{fontFamily: "sans-serif", fontSize: "1.5rem", marginBottom: "2rem" }}>
        Dermestid beetles are a group of beetles that are commonly 
        referred to as “skin beetles.” You might also know them as 
        “carpet beetles,” and perhaps you have even dealt with carpet 
        beetles living alongside you and chewing up your carpet and 
        furniture. Skin beetles, on the other hand, are used in Zoology 
        for a specific purpose — one that is often considered both 
        disgusting and fascinating. Both in the museum and outside 
        of the museum, skin beetles help with decay. They can eat 
        almost anything, but in the wild they tend to eat the remains 
        of animals and are considered detritivores. With many hours 
        alone feeding, cleaning enclosures, watering, and observing 
        the life and purpose of the dermestid beetles, I was inspired 
        by their miniature realities. It was interesting to be in the 
        position to take care of these small animals and to deeply 
        understand that they would not be able to survive if I was 
        not around. Their lives are so different from ours, and yet 
        they require all the same basic things — food, water, and 
        empathy. And, in their own way, they give back, contributing 
        to the cycle of life and the world of science. I found that, 
        over time, I developed a sense of kinship with the little 
        creatures and that bong was one of the main inspirations for 
        this project.
        </p>

        <p style={{fontFamily: "sans-serif", fontSize: "1.5rem", marginBottom: "2rem" }}>
        Bugs are often overlooked. They’re viewed as inconvenient, 
        disgusting, annoying, and ugly. Their lives are not given 
        care and they are not spared mercy, often killed in cruel 
        and torturous ways. And yet, we cannot exist without them, 
        and they are a part — however small — of the expansive life 
        on Earth that must be cherished for its rarity and for our 
        own experience of it. Furthermore, when taking a step away 
        from the empathy of bugs and from bugs, I believe that the 
        way we as humans treat bugs is a reflection of how we treat 
        each other on a whole. Those deemed inconvenient, disgusting, 
        annoying, and ugly are treated as such. Although this project 
        is abstract, I hope that you gather from it that the way we 
        define things, whether insects, people, or ourselves, is vitally 
        important to how the world views and treats those things, and 
        that definitions are more than just words. They can be life or 
        death. And even more so in today&rsquo;s world.
        </p>

        <p style={{fontFamily: "sans-serif", fontSize: "1.5rem", marginBottom: "2rem" }}>
        I encourage you to consider the insects around you and 
        to treat them with the kindness you might treat a mammal, 
        a bird, your pets, your friends, or your family, even if 
        that kindness looks different for the bug than your closest 
        companion. We aren’t really all that different, anyway.

        Uninspired Art
        </p>

        <p style={{fontFamily: "sans-serif", fontSize: "1.5rem", marginBottom: "2rem" }}>
        Inspirations for this project were vast, including early 
        internet web-design and callbacks to such design by my 
        favorite contemporary artists (think Magdalena Bay, Oklou, 
        Hildegard and more). I have always had a tendency toward 
        existentialism and thinking about the absolute scale of things. 
        Insects’ lives are so small and yet their essence has been 
        preserved in time for millenia, longer than humans have 
        even existed, trapped in amber. Climate change and the 
        marathonic time-scales of Earth’s geology, evolution, and 
        celestial forms fed the idea for this project. Similarly, 
        in today’s digital world, thinking about preservation over 
        time and what we can actually consider to be preserved 
        digitally was at the forefront — as insects trapped in amber, 
        can our digital works truly be preserved for years to come 
        when our digital worlds are only in their infancy? And when 
        social, humanitarian, and climate-related challenges threaten 
        that infrastructure? 
        </p>

        <p style={{fontFamily: "sans-serif", fontSize: "1.5rem", marginBottom: "2rem" }}>
        Though the themes of this project are abstract, 
        I hope that the imagery, lyricism, sampling, and 
        music production evoke those thoughts, feelings, and 
        discourse. The music itself is not necessarily meant 
        to be enjoyed on its own. It’s all about sound design, 
        playing with supertonality and delay and strange rhythms. 
        It also incorporates found sound because all music is 
        ultimately a reflection of the natural world. It is 
        imperfect, because as all of us, I am learning continually about
        music theory, music production, songwriting, and sound design.
        </p>

        <p style={{fontFamily: "sans-serif", fontSize: "1.5rem", marginBottom: "2rem" }}>
        Because of the relative abstraction of this work, 
        its methodology led to my coining of the term 
        Uninspired art. Uninspired art, to me, is not art 
        that has no inspiration but rather art that is self-inspiring, 
        unreplicable, and intentionally imperfect.
        </p>

        <p style={{fontFamily: "sans-serif", fontSize: "1.5rem", marginBottom: "2rem" }}>
        I hope you can find solace in such a form, and through this project.

        Renaissance of the Concept Album
        </p>

        <p style={{fontFamily: "sans-serif", fontSize: "1.5rem", marginBottom: "2rem" }}>
          I was also inspired by the recent revival, or renaissance, 
          of the concept album. Music has always been a medium for 
          thematic expression, and yet the new decade has seemingly 
          been defined by a new era of conceptual music and accompanying 
          visual or spatial works. Take Magdalena Bay as a prime — but 
          not the only — example. Take FKA Twigs’ Eusexua; Ha Vay’s Baby 
          I’m The Wolf, Halsey’s The Great Impersonator among many, 
          many others. With these pieces of concept art come new methods 
          of storytelling which often expand into the ever-present digital 
          world. Visual albums moving beyond one-off music videos into 
          full standalone art projects; interactive websites that expand 
          the digital world’s collective map; transcendent live performances 
          that combine aural, visual, and movement-based technique are 
          among some of the more popular forms although others are 
          emerging by the day. Most examples that I see are within the definition of
          pop music, and I am eager to see more varied storytelling within
          different genres. I also hope that by expanding storytelling
          we can collectively expand the defining boundaries of 
          music itself, changing the way we view and hear music
          of different genres. One of the ways that technology has 
          a profound impact on society is through its ability to 
          create and transmit methods of storytelling that might 
          otherwise be inaccessible. And the best part about these 
          technologies is that they are always becoming easier to 
          learn, use, and design.

        <p style={{fontFamily: "sans-serif", fontSize: "1.5rem", marginBottom: "2rem" }}>
          In Amber is meant to be participatory, 
          expanding the viewer’s idea of what it means 
          to tell a story. The how is just as important as 
          the why in many cases. Music, art, and storytelling 
          have always gone hand in hand, and imagining new ways 
          to share and propagate those stories is how we arrive 
          at the future from our shared past.

        I want to thank all who have supported this project. 
        First, Dr. Matthew Thompson who has provided a year’s 
        worth of invaluable feedback, time, and expertise. The 
        Thompson Prize has been integral to finding joy through 
        creativity during a very tough year, and I’m so thankful to 
        Dr. Thompson for providing the opportunity to learn and create. 
        I also want to thank Ola Ifidon, who is also a recipient of the 
        Thompson Prize. Ola’s words of wisdom, encouragement, and 
        thoughtfulness have been deeply helpful to the project. 
        Ola&rsquo;s work, &rsquo;Sankofa&rsquo; was crafted with so much 
        intention and deep understanding, and it very much shows in 
        her work. It has been a pleasure to work with Ola over the 
        past year.
        </p>

        <p style={{fontFamily: "sans-serif", fontSize: "1.5rem", marginBottom: "2rem" }}>
          I also want to thank my family and friends who have 
          supported me in this project. In Amber was mixed and 
          mastered by my partner Jack Withers. I am so grateful 
          for his support throughout the year working on this 
          project, as well as his delicate touch with my music. 
          Jack’s music has been a huge inspiration to me for many 
          years and to have put together a project worthy of his 
          mixing and mastering skills is a huge achievement for me! 
        </p>

        <p style={{fontFamily: "sans-serif", fontSize: "1.5rem", marginBottom: "2rem" }}>
          I also want to thank my parents and my sister Ione for 
          their support. I also want to give Ione a special 
          shoutout for doing vocals on ‘Attack of Giant Mutant Cicada’ 
          in my bedroom all those years ago — who knew it would end up 
          on an entire album almost five years later! 
        </p>

        <p style={{fontFamily: "sans-serif", fontSize: "1.5rem", marginBottom: "2rem" }}>
          And thank you to many more who have followed along in
